            <h1>Dodge charger</h1>
            <p>Muscle cars are meant to bark through the neighborhood between streetlights, and the Dodge Charger has been off its leash for plenty of years now. More than a decade into its current generation, the seemingly ageless Charger comes standard with a 292-hp V-6 and rear-wheel drive, with an all-wheel drive option should you need it. Consider this version the calm older dog of the lineup. But there’s also bark and bite in the Charger family. Step up to the R/T trim for the 370-hp 5.7-liter V-8 engine. Scat Pack models get even more power, with a 6.4-liter, 485-hp V-8. The tire-killing supercharged Hellcat models get even wilder but are reviewed separately. If the Charger drives like an old cop car, that’s because it is. And while the world shifts to alternative energy, the Charger keeps on chugging along as a sedan version of the coupe-bodied, gasoline-fired Challenger. One day cars like the Charger will be against all the rules, but for now this V-8-powered sedan remains loud and proud.</p>

            <h1>Dodge challenger</h1>
            <p>While rival muscle cars have pivoted recently toward sharp handling, the 2023 Dodge Challenger keeps things retro with a package that’s designed more for old-school pony-car jollies and straight-line speed. A V-6 engine is standard in these non-SRT Challengers but the real fun comes with the optional naturally aspirated Hemi V-8 engines, which are offered in a variety of displacements and outputs spanning a 375-hp, 5.7-liter to a 485-hp, 6.4-liter. If you want even more power, Dodge will be happy to oblige with the big-stomper Challenger SRT Hellcat, which we review separately. The regular Challenger isn’t as intense as the outrageous Hellcat, but for some its V-8 burble and relatively comfortable ride will be enough to trigger nostalgic feelings for the vintage Dodge pony cars with which it shares a name. Enthusiast drivers will find modern versions of the Chevrolet Camaro and the Ford Mustang more capable on twisty roads and racetracks, but the Challenger’s old-school charm is undeniable.            </p>
