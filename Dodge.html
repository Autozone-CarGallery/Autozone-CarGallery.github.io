            <h1>Dodge charger</h1>
            <p>Muscle cars are meant to bark through the neighborhood between streetlights, and the Dodge Charger has
                been off its leash for plenty of years now. More than a decade into its current generation, the
                seemingly ageless Charger comes standard with a 292-hp V-6 and rear-wheel drive, with an all-wheel drive
                option should you need it. Consider this version the calm older dog of the lineup. But there’s also bark
                and bite in the Charger family. Step up to the R/T trim for the 370-hp 5.7-liter V-8 engine. Scat Pack
                models get even more power, with a 6.4-liter, 485-hp V-8. The tire-killing supercharged Hellcat models
                get even wilder but are reviewed separately. If the Charger drives like an old cop car, that’s because
                it is. And while the world shifts to alternative energy, the Charger keeps on chugging along as a sedan
                version of the coupe-bodied, gasoline-fired Challenger. One day cars like the Charger will be against
                all the rules, but for now this V-8-powered sedan remains loud and proud.</p>
